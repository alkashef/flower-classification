# Flower Classification

In this project, I train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. That is, given an image of a flower, it returns its species. I'm using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories. A few examples can be seen below.

## Project Setup

`main.ipynb` contains the project code and documentation. The notebook is designed such that:
- It lives on Github 
- It can either run on a local machine or [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com)
```
colab = False # execute on local machine
#colab = True # execute on Google Colabs
```

The notebook can be modified in Colabs editor and checked-into Github automatically (File > Save a copy to Github...)
