# Flower Classification

In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. That is, given an image of a flower, it will return its species. I'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories. A few examples can be seen below.
